## Approach

View notes 20 characters each

- [x] object that holds notes
- [x] instantiate notes
- [x] retrieve list of notes
- [x] note function that returns first 20 characters of the note body
- [x] a way to get those 20 characters onto the page as an element
- [x] create a list of HTML elements as links on the page
- [x] updates every time new note is added

Create a note

- [x] generate text box element
- [x] generate a submit button
- [x] get text from text box and put it into a element on the page
- [x] new note object
- [x] clear text element box when note is generated
- [x] stop empty notes being added

Create note Manager
- [x] holds an array of note objects
- [x] create addNote method to add note objects to array
- [x] create getNote method to retrieve a note

View full note

- [x] clicking link suppresses default event and triggers custom event
- [x] retrieve particular note's full text
- [x] generate HTML element that holds full note text
